# Advent of Code 2025

I'm trying to do it in Elixir, without knowing the language, do not expect the most "alchemic" code from these solutions.

If in a day I cannot figure out how to do something in it I will use python and just write the worst code I can to get the solution.

Maybe during the holdidays I will try to refactor the solutions.
